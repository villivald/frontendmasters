As a result:

- **40% of users** abandon a website that takes more than **3 seconds** to load
- **75% of users** will not return to sites perceived as slow
- Low Core Web Vitals result in lower SEO rankings

### Legacy Metrics

- Waterfall charts - show how long each type of resource takes to load
- DOMContentLoaded (DCL) - the HTML donwloaded, parsed and deferred scripts are executed, images/media may still be loading
- Load event (L) - all resources have been downloaded and rendered (except lazy-loaded resources)
- The problem - legacy metrics are not applicable to modern web applications (SPA, SSR, PWA, etc.)
