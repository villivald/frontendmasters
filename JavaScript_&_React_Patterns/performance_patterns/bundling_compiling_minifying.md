# Bundlers

Bundlers combine project files into a executable version of the project.

- Webpack
- Parcel
- Rollup
- Snowpack
- Vite

# Compilers

Compilers convert code from one version into another version of the same language. E.g. they are used to convert ES6+ code into ES5 code.

- Babel
- TypeScript
- Elm

# Minifiers

Minifiers are used to reduce the size of the code.

- Terser
- UglifyJS
- SWC, Esbuild - combine bundling, compiling and minifying

# Practices

- Bundle splitting - creating multiple, smaller bundles rather than one large bundle
- Tree shaking - eliminating dead code
