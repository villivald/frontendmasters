## Web UX Design

Emotional decisions:
- primal brain (flight or fight)

Unconscious desicions:
- system one: automatic, intuitive and emotional mode
- system two: logical, slower and more effortful

Lazy thinking:
- relying on system two and own biases

Dark patterns:
- manipulating users
- colors and positions, "almost gone"- types of messages, etc.
- alienating and annoying users, brands credibility suffers
- hidden costs -> marketing costs increase, support become overloaded

Psychological principles:
- do not make the user to search for answer
- make the risk worth taking (focus on benefits, give the uses control)
- website can feel unfair, unfamiliar, untrue or hard to use
- establish trust, demonstrate humanity and empathy
- tell a story (use real people, real images, etc.)
- performance impacts conversion

Content:
- Who are you users? Their use cases, problems, tasks (Users journey)
- Value proposition - promise or value, eg. solving particular problem
- What benefit customer can expect
- Why user should choose this products vs. competing products
-> Should correlate with user profile
- Strapline - description
- Benefits - how the product helps audience
- Delivery - how you will deliver the features

Writing a copy:
- Content hierarchy
- Compelling headline
- Scannability of a content
- Should sound like human
- Simplify the users choice
- Reflex the mental model of a potential audience

Design:
- Leading the users attention:
  - Simplify
    - Is it possible to remove something?
    - Can you hide something?
    - Maybe you can shrink it?
  - Consider the page flow
    - step 1, step 2, step 3, etc.
  - Consider how people read
    - f-shaped pattern
    - length and height of the text line
  - Use imagery and shapes
    - use images to break up the text
    - use shapes to draw attention
    - take into account the eye motion
- Calls to actions:
  - simple, clear and descriptive (eg. "Buy now")
  - do not fixate on fold (call to action can be anywhere)
  - empty space around draws attention
  - colors, size and animation can be used to draw attention as well
  - break complex actions into steps
  - consider the post click experience
- Engaging users with aesthetics:
  - perception
  - humor
  - halo effect
