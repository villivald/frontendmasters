## Web UX Design

Emotional decisions:
- primal brain (flight or fight)

Unconscious desicions:
- system one: automatic, intuitive and emotional mode
- system two: logical, slower and more effortful

Lazy thinking:
- relying on system two and own biases

Dark patterns:
- manipulating users
- colors and positions, "almost gone"- types of messages, etc.
- alienating and annoying users, brands credibility suffers
- hidden costs -> marketing costs increase, support become overloaded

Psychological principles:
- do not make the user to search for answer
- make the risk worth taking (focus on benefits, give the uses control)
- website can feel unfair, unfamiliar, untrue or hard to use
- establish trust, demonstrate humanity and empathy
- tell a story (use real people, real images, etc.)
- performance impacts conversion

Content:
- Who are you users? Their use cases, problems, tasks (Users journey)
- Value proposition - promise or value, eg. solving particular problem
- What benefit customer can expect
- Why user should choose this products vs. competing products
-> Should correlate with user profile
- Strapline - description
- Benefits - how the product helps audience
- Delivery - how you will deliver the features

Writing a copy:
- Content hierarchy
- Compelling headline
- Scannability of a content
- Should sound like human
- Simplify the users choice
