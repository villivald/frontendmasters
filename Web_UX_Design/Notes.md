## Web UX Design

Emotional decisions:
- primal brain (flight or fight)

Unconscious desicions:
- system one: automatic, intuitive and emotional mode
- system two: logical, slower and more effortful

Lazy thinking:
- relying on system two and own biases

Dark patterns:
- manipulating users
- colors and positions, "almost gone"- types of messages, etc.
- alienating and annoying users, brands credibility suffers
- hidden costs -> marketing costs increase, support become overloaded

Psychological principles:
- do not make the user to search for answer
- make the risk worth taking (focus on benefits, give the uses control)
- website can feel unfair, unfamiliar, untrue or hard to use
- establish trust, demonstrate humanity and empathy
- tell a story (use real people, real images, etc.)
- performance impacts conversion
