# Machine Learning in JavaScript with TensorFlow.js - FrontEnd Masters

Check out the [course website](https://fem-ml-workshop.netlify.app)

## Workshop projects

The workshop projects can be found in the `exercises` folder. Each exercise has a README file with instructions on how to run it.

You will find empty files called `part1.js`, `part2.js`, etc. for each sub project in which you should write your JavaScript code as you go through the workshop.

## Project Instructions

We recommend using `Node version 20`. For each project, change directories and install the dependencies. For example:

```bash
cd exercises/project-1/
npm install
npm run watch
```

## Projects' solutions

There is a `solutions` folder with the solution to each exercise if you need to see the completed project at any time. This folder contains all the code written during the workshop.

You will also find a folder called `solutions-old` that contains the original code I was planning on writing in the workshop if you want to have a look. It is very close to what we ended up doing during the course, only with a few little adjustments, such as more layers in the custom model.
