## What are pre-trained models?

A pre-trained model is a model already trained and tested, ready to be used in your application.

These models can be image recognition models, text classification models, sentiment analysis models, and more.

## Finding pre-trained models

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/models) and more specifically [TensorFlow.js models](https://www.kaggle.com/search?q=tensorflow.js+in%3Amodels)
- [TensorFlow.js models](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models)
- [Hugging face](https://huggingface.co/models)

## Choosing the right model

When you start building your machine learning application, focus on the following points:

- What are you building?
- Quality of the training data
- Quantity of the training data
- Can you have access to the list of classes/labels?
