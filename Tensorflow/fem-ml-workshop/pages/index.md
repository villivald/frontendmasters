Hi, I'm Charlie Gerard, staff engineer at Socket and creative technologist.
I've been doing front-end development for the past 10 years and, on my personal time, I love to explore creative technologies, including machine learning.
I'm excited to be your instructor for this workshop about TensorFlow.js, and share with you what I've learnt building projects since 2018.

## Prerequisites

For this workshop, you'll need to have the following tools installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) version 20 or above
- Npm
- A code editor (I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Your browser of choice (I use Chrome)

This workshop does not require any prior knowledge about machine learning or artificial intelligence but assumes existing knowledge and experience using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
