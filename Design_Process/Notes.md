## Issues of a design process

Running a design project

- Scope creep - snowball effect, client wants more and more as the development progresses
- Subjectiveness - endless iterations, Frankenstein design
- Iteration hell

Avoiding pitfalls

- objectivity - data driven decisions
- involving client more often - providing a sense of ownership
- reassurance - providing a sense of security

Design principles

- [principles.design](https://principles.design/)
- agreeing before starting

Design process (and its issues)

- developer is forced to design without content
- design comes as a surprise
- client does not provide a quality feedback
- iterations are hard to predict
- final version looks different than the original design
- project involves a lot of risks

Speculative design

- practice of producing unpaid design work for clients to prove your skills
- potentially wasteful and costs money for everyone involved
- uninformed and not collaborative

## Improving the design process

Discovery phase

- Defining the problem being solved and the scope of the project
- Helps reduce scope creep and provides a context for the design process
- User research, interview, competitive analysis, review of existing products, etc.
- Investigation of resources, budget, and timeline
- Defining the stakeholders and their roles - finding problems vs finding solutions
- → Clear roadmap

Prototyping phase

- Establishing the direction of the design and the scope of the project
- Allows to validate design approaches and avoid costly changes later in the process
- Design mockups, wireframing, usability and aesthetic testing, etc.
- → Navigable wireframe, demo of integration of aestetics and structure

Build phase

- Turning the design into a working product
- Should involve the designer to ensure the design is implemented correctly
- Responsive design, design system, etc.
- → Developer should be able to implement the design

Live phase

- Launching the product and providing support, monitoring user behavior, and adjusting the design as needed
- At this point it is possible to observe user behavior and adjust the design accordingly (Microsoft Clarity)
- Analytics, A/B testing, heatmaps, session recording, usability testing, etc.
- → Working product with potential for further improvements
