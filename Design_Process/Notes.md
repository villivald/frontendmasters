Running a design project

- Scope creep - snowball effect, client wants more and more as the development progresses
- Subjectiveness - endless iterations, Frankenstein design
- Iteration hell

Avoiding pitfalls

- objectivity - data driven decisions
- involving client more often - providing a sense of ownership
- reassurance - providing a sense of security
